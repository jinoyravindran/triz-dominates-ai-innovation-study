## Scoring Methodology Integration

Each enhanced idea is evaluated using identical criteria regardless of technique:

### Automated Scoring Components:
1. **Innovation Score** (0-100): Extracted from AI analysis of novelty and breakthrough potential
2. **Feasibility Score** (0-100): Based on word count, complexity, and implementation details
3. **Market Potential Score** (0-100): Keyword-based analysis of market indicators
4. **Processing Metrics**: Word count, processing time, content structure

### Final Score Calculation:
```
Final Score = 0.25 × Academic Score + 0.35 × Business Score + 0.25 × Content Score + 0.15 × Efficiency Score

Where:
Academic Score = 0.40 × Innovation + 0.25 × Structure + 0.20 × Market + 0.15 × Efficiency
Business Score = 0.35 × Feasibility + 0.30 × Market + 0.20 × Risk + 0.15 × Innovation
Content Score = 0.40 × Depth + 0.30 × Structure + 0.30 × Innovation
Efficiency Score = Processing time and resource optimization metrics
```

## Bias Prevention Measures

### Template Standardization:
- Identical base structure for all techniques

- Top-p: 0.9 (nucleus sampling for quality)

### Prompt Engineering Principles:
1. **Clarity**: Each prompt clearly states the technique and requirements
2. **Consistency**: All prompts follow identical structure and formatting
3. **Completeness**: All necessary context provided without bias
4. **Specificity**: Technique-specific requirements clearly articulated
5. **Fairness**: No technique receives advantages in prompt design

### Validation Measures:
- Human expert review of prompt templates
- Cross-technique comparison of prompt complexity
- Bias detection through linguistic analysis
- Multiple model testing to ensure prompt robustness
